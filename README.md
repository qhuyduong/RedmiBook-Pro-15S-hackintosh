## What's partially working

Type | Info | Status
:---------|:---------|:----------
Deep sleep | Unable to achieve deep sleep, which results in shorter battery life | ⚠️
APU | When using some software that supports hardware acceleration, the system will replace the card and then recover, It is recommended to turn off hardware acceleration directly.   Then wait for the author to support the APU | ⚠️
Virtualization technology | Not supported.  If you have virtualization needs you can use a small computer with ARM architecture instead | ⚠️
